\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have worked on the problem of content moderation by detecting and identifying euphemisms. 
By utilizing the contextual information, we not only obtain new state-of-the-art detection results, but also discover new euphemisms that are not even on the ground truth list. 
For euphemism identification, we, for the first time, prove the feasibility of the task and achieve it on a raw text corpus alone, without relying on any additional resources or supervision. 




\section*{Reproducibility}
The code and pre-trained models are available at an anonymous link: \red{\url{Anonymous Github Link}}. 
We will make them publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.
